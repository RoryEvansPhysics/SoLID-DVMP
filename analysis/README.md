# Work-Flow to perform DVMP Simualtion with SoLID
## -- Zhihong Ye 04/19/2017

## Generate DVMP Simulated Events -- by Zafar Ahmed
### There are few different version of the MC events

  * Clean events w/o any effects
  * Add Fermi-Motion of neutrons in th etarget
  * Add Final-State-Interaction of outgoing pion
  * Add Energy-Loss and Multiple-Scattering effects of incoming and outgoing electrons, pion and proton

### Generated events with target polarization UP and DOWN separately
### Calculate total cross sections (dXS=dXS_UU+dXS_UT), where six different UT terms based on different angular modules are also given
### Every quantity is save in the lab frame


## Add SoLID Acceptance, Resolution and Missing Mass info in the rootfile
### The code "AddBranch.C" does this job and it also only saves events with Q2>4 GeV^2

 * SoLID Acceptance is given in histograms which were generated by runing GEMC simulation
 * SoLID detector resolutions are added by giveing the resolution of momenta, scattered angles and azimuthal angles for all three final state particles
 * Note to use the "corrected" quantities(p, theta,phi) in the lab frame to obtain the acceptances
 * When reconstructing missing mass and momentum, use the "corrected"+"resolution smeared" quantities
 * To avoid confusion, different polarized XS and weights were recalculated based on the asymmetries

## Plot Missing Mass and Momentum Spectra with DEMP and SIDIS events
### The code "./missing_mass/Missing_Mass.C" does this job

### Use the code "./makebin/skim.C" to dvidie the root files into small files for individual -t bins or -tp bins
 * Names correspond to different configurations:
 ```js
    simple->No Fermi, EL, MS, FSI
    fermi->Only Fermi
    mult_nofermi-> EL, MS, but not Fermi
    mult-> Fermi, EL, MS
    mult_fsi-> Fermi, EL, MS, FSI
 ```
 * If binning on "t", using the following boundry:
```js
    t_cut[8+1] = {0.00, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.80, 1.10, 2.0};
```
 * If binning on "tp", using the following boundry:
```js
    tp_cut[11+1] = {0.0,0.025,0.05,0.075,0.100, 0.150,0.200,0.250,0.350,0.4,0.7};
```

## Reconstruct "Experimental" Asymmetry and perform fitting to extract angular modulations.
### The code "./asym_extr/FitMinuit.C" does the job with the TMinuitpackage.
 * It is a unbinned Maximin-Likelihood Minuit method
 
## Perform Binning on Phi and PhiS for plotting
### The code "./makebin/makebin.C" does the job, still under developments
